1. Aesthetic are the quantifiable features of the resulting graphic that map data values using data visualization. Example: Shapes, colors, etc.
2. The classes are: a) Representation of Continuous data, b) Representation of Discrete data.
3. Two major types of data are: 
	a) Continuous numerical data, Example: 2.6, 11.4, 167.
	b) Discrete numerical data, Example: 4, 5, 6, 7.
4. Factors
5. 	Ordered data Example: stop, wait, go.
	Unordered data Example: one, hair, food.
6. Non-linear axis
7. We can assume that when we illustrate a data regarding growth or decline, visualizing the rate of growth rather than the full population.
8. Used for data with a periodic nature.
9. Types of different color scales:
	1. Quanlitative Color Scale. Used to distinguish between discrete items like countires.
	2. Sequential Color Scale: Used to represent data values like income.
	3. Diverging Color Scale: Used to represent data that have a relation with a neutal midpoint.
	4. Accent Color Scale: Used to represent data that needs particular data highlighted.
10. No unit specified for density, age should not be less than zero.
11. Exponential function in first phase. Constant in second phase. 
12. Purple to Green color.
